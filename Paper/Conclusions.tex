\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

In this paper we motivated the use of multiple robots in mapping to decrease the time to map an environment and increase the likelihood that mapping objective is completed.  We presented some background of MRSLAM, implemented Howardâ€™s algorithm for map merging using the integration of data from several independent robots, as well as presented a modified the algorithm that uses a particle filter for each robot.  

This modification has qualitatively shown to reduce pose error, and resulted in a better map without a significant change in performance.

Future work would include a more thorough literature review to see if this approach has been proposed, attempt to build even better proposal distributions or use adaptive resampling to avoid particle depletion \cite{Grisetti2007}.
