\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

In this paper we motivated the use of multiple robots in mapping to decrease the time to map an environment and increase the likelihood that mapping objective is completed.  We presented the background of MRSLAM, detailed discussion of Howardâ€™s algorithm \cite{howard2006multi} for map merging using the integration of data from several independent robots, as well as presented a modified the algorithm that uses a particle filter for each robot.  

We then qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrated that the independent resampling approach resulted in a better map without a significant change in performance, and decreased minimum sum of squares error.

Future work would include a more thorough literature review to see if this approach has been proposed, attempt to build even better proposal distributions or use adaptive resampling to avoid rapid particle depletion that this method most likely results in \cite{Grisetti2007}.
