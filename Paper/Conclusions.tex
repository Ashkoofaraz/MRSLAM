\section{Conclusion}


In this paper we have presented Howardâ€™s algorithm from \cite{howard2006multi} for the integration of data from several independent robots, and demonstrated a successful implementation.  Further, we have modified the algorithm to use a particle filter for each robot and demonstrated that it can qualitatively
